# DataStorm-4-Storming-Round

## Business Problem

Beverages Company XYZ produces over 40 beverage items and distributes them to more than 100 stores. However, they lack a data-driven decision-making process when it comes to making critical decisions such as resource allocation, distribution, and introducing new beverage items. The company makes such decisions qualitatively based on experience rather than leveraging data to optimize these decisions. In recent times, these approaches were found to be inefficient, and the company wants to improve their decision-making process through advanced analytics and machine learning techniques by performing a store profiling on the existing and new stores based on their sales and customer behaviours. The task is to design and develop an advanced analytics solution that can be used by Beverages Company XYZ to perform store profiling and enhance their decision-making process.

## Use Case Definition

The initial solution they developed was to classify the existing outlets as High, Moderate, and Low based on a salesperson's point of view. However, they now seek an advanced analytics solution to automate this process for the new stores. They have been collecting various data for the past six months at the store level and store-customer transaction level. The purpose of store profiling is to allocate resources such as equipment, marketing, and staffing to improve the performance of low-rated stores and to optimize the process of item range decisions.
In the Kaggle competition, the following items should be submitted:
Analytical Solution: An advanced analytics solution that can identify the profile of given outlets as High, Moderate, or Low. This solution should be submitted as a CSV file, which contains the Shop_id and the Shop_profile using the given Testing-data set. The F1 metric will be used for evaluation.

## You can find the data sets that you need below:

* Historical-transaction-data.csv - contains the historical transaction data set with 488,788 records collected from each customer purchase. The granularity of the data set is at the date-customer-invoice-item level.
* Store-info.csv - contains the store info data set with 124 stores with shop space and store profile. The granularity of the data set is at the store level.
* Testing-data.csv - the test set for the competition.
* Data-dictionary.xlsx - contains the information about data attributes for both data sets.
* DataStorm4.0_KaggleProblemStatement.pdf - Detailed explanation of the problem along with the marking criteria.
